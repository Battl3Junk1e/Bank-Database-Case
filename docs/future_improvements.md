# Future Improvements

This section outlines several areas where the Big Bank database can be improved:

- **Indexing and Performance Optimization:**  
  Introduce additional indexes, especially on frequently queried columns, to improve performance.

- **Stored Procedures and Triggers:**  
  Implement stored procedures for common operations (e.g., fund transfers, fee applications) and triggers for auditing or enforcing business rules.

- **Enhanced Data Integrity:**  
  Add further constraints, validations, and possibly check constraints to ensure data accuracy and consistency.

- **Partitioning and Scalability:**  
  Consider table partitioning for large tables (like transactions) and assess scalability for growing data volumes.

- **Security and Auditing:**  
  Enhance security measures such as encryption for sensitive data and implement audit trails for critical operations.

- **Documentation and Code Comments:**  
  Improve inline documentation within SQL scripts and consider auto-generating documentation based on schema definitions.

- **Backup and Recovery Strategies:**  
  Develop robust backup procedures and disaster recovery plans.

- **User-defined Data Types:**  
  Use custom data types to standardize data input for columns like phone numbers, email addresses, etc.
